% Problem 1372. Miles to go before I sleep
%  Created by James 
% 
% Recently, my car's odometer passed 56789. Given an odometer reading, 
% output how many miles need to be driven to get the next mileage made up 
% of consecutive increasing numbers. If the mileage is already made up of 
% consecutive digits, output 0.
% 
% Use the digits 0-9 only. For example, if your odometer is at 67903 miles, 
%     your script should output 10998, which is the number of miles needed 
%     to reach 78901 (7-8-9-0-1), rather than 78910 (7-8-9-10).
% 
% You may need to increase the number of digits in your odometer reading to 
% accomplish this task. For example, a reading of 9843 means that you will 
% need to travel 2502 miles to get to 12345. However, a reading of 9011 
% needs only one more mile to get to 9012.
